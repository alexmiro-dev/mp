#mp - Memory Pool
This is a work-in-progress (WIP) implementation for a memory pool using C++23.

# Disclaimer
The current implementation is not intended to be used in a production environment because it is in its early stages.

There is no benchmark yet, nor have many use cases for this library been addressed, which means that the architecture could be significantly changed shortly.
